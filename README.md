I Learned how and when to use backticks. I didn't copy and paste. I followed the tutorial while trying to put my own twist on it. also it doesn't fully work if you watch the tutorial and see how it is suppossed to fully function.. mine does not. and I could not debug where the error was coming from. it took 3 days to fully accomplish it. I had to pause and look things up so that I understood what going on like the backticks. I also learned ternary operators which by the way are very useful to shorten/simplify code and I used them in other projects. I also fell into the spiral pit of truthy and falsey while learning about these. I have posted the credit video below, but the mass amount of knowledge I learned from following this tuttorial just is worth more to me than any grade or outcome. If I had to go back I would have notated the credit earlier that was a simple misatake on my part. but I do not regret learning everything I did from it.
