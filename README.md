I Learned how and when to use backticks. I didn't copy and paste. I followed the tutorial while trying to put my own twist on it.. I had to pause and look things up so that I understood what was going on like backticks. I also learned ternary operators which by the way are very useful to shorten/simplify code and I used them in other projects. I also fell into the spiral pit of truthy and falsey while learning about these, very intriguing stuff. I have posted the credit video below.
